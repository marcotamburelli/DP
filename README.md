# DP
The central idea of DP is to provide an instrument to setup quickly and easily a single page application in data driven flavour. Requirements are:
1. Minimal amount of lightweight dependencies.
2. No boilerplate code.
3. No DSL, just javascript/typescript and JSX/TSX defining almost pure HTML.
4. Strongly typed (typescript recommended).
